# MyCodingTeam

 This uses autogen to generate multiple agents:
   - coder
   - tester
   - program manager
   - user

 Together they can create code, verify them, create documentation etc. 

 # setup:

 either use source sourceme ( on mac and linux )

 or

 python3.11 -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 python src/coding_team.py 

 # consideration

 you will also need openai api key or ollama installed for these to work.
 
# Future steps:
- enable conversation log
- problem statement as argument or gui
- save work files etx
